      <description>In this post, we will discuss how to setup &amp;amp; run mysql using docker
Goal We want to setup mysql using docker, but also want to provide our custom configurations for mysql and save mysql data into our machine. The reason of choosing docker over direct mysql installation into the machine is, we want to switch between mysql hosting machines with ease &amp;amp; start-stop mysql into our macine easily.
Prerequisite Docker &amp;amp; Docker-compose should already be setup into your machine beforehand.</description>
