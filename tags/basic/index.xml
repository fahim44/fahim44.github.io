      <description>A Computer Program is a sequence of instructions written in a programing language which can be executed or interpreted in a computer system.
When we engineers/programmers/developers write any program in any programing language of our choice, we actually write in very human-readable language. This is called source code. We can understand what source code is describing; but the computer only knows binary, &amp;amp; it can only execute programs which is written in machine instructions.</description>
